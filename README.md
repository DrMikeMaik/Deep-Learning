# Deep Learning in Tensorflow

## Data
The data for the two algorithms can be optained from the Kaggle site. After downloading it should be placed in a folder called **data** in order for the code to work.

The MNIST dataset can found [here](www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer).

The Facial Expression Recognition dat can be found [here](www.kaggle.com/c/challenges-in-representation-learning-facial-expression-recognition-challenge).

## MNIST
The 'Hello World.' problem of any data scientist. Pretty much the simplest Tensorflow implementation of recognizing hand written digits. About 97% accuracy is attained with model with L1 regularization

## Facial Expression Recognition
Same implementaion as for MNIST but on a more complex dataset. The results are nowhere near as impresive. The best attained accuracy is around 40%. Clearly this is better suited for a Convolutional Neural Network.
